# XSS-payloads Collection
This repository contains a curated list of **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads** for educational and penetration testing purposes. These payloads are collected, tested, and categorized for bypassing various filters and web application firewalls (WAFs), including HTML sanitizers, Content Security Policy (CSP), and more.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
This project is intended **only for ethical hacking**, security research, and educational purposes. **Do not use** these payloads on systems you do not own or have permission to test. Unauthorized access or attacks are illegal and unethical.
